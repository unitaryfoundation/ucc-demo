UCC's goal is to gather together the best of open source compilation to make quantum programming simpler, faster, and more scalable.

This notebook gives you a flavor of where `ucc` is heading, but there's plenty of work ahead to drive utility and adoption. Early feedback is precious to ensuring that direction will be fruitful."
